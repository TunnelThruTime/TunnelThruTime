- 👋 Hi, I’m @TunnelThruTime
- 👀 I’m interested in python urwid module or I used to be interested into this module
  until I wrote a bunch of code for it surrounding a project that is cli daw. It is a very simple DAW built to
  go through a list of songs, and create demonstrations for them very slowly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, urwid, lilypond, music21, and shell scripting and improving my
  craft as a songwriter, developer and musicologist.
  I'm also an active performer although there is not really a place for this currently online.
  My music can be found at [L.A. Lawlor dot ca](www.lalawlor.ca). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything python, or music related.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
